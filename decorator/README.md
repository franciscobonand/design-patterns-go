# Decorator pattern

- Facilitates the addition of behaviours to individual objects through embedding
- This comes from the need to augment an object with additional functionality
    - Without altering existing code (Open-closed principle)
    - Keeping the new functionality separate (Single responsability principle)
    - Still be able to interact with the existing structures
- Often used to emulate multiple inheritance
