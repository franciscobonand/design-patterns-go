# Façade pattern

- Provides a simple, easy to use/understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code
- Build a Façade to provide a simplified API over a set of components
- May optionally expose internals through the façade
- May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if they need to
