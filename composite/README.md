- Objects use other object's fields/methods through embedding
- Composition makes it possible to compound objects
- **Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly**
    - Is a mechanims for treating individual objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner
- Iteration supported with the Iterator design pattern (see example in `neurons.go`)
